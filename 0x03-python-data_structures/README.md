# Python Data Structures: Lists and Tuples

## Description
This project focuses on understanding Python's fundamental data structures, particularly lists and tuples, and their associated functionalities.

## Learning Objectives

- **What are Lists and How to Use Them**
  - Introduction to lists in Python, including how to create and manipulate them.

- **What are the Differences and Similarities Between Strings and Lists**
  - A comparison of strings and lists, highlighting their shared characteristics and key differences.

- **What are the Most Common Methods of Lists and How to Use Them**
  - Overview of frequently used list methods such as `append()`, `extend()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `clear()`, `index()`, `count()`, `sort()`, `reverse()`, and `copy()`.

- **How to Use Lists as Stacks and Queues**
  - Explanation of how to implement stack and queue data structures using lists in Python.

- **What are List Comprehensions and How to Use Them**
  - A guide to creating lists using list comprehensions for more concise and readable code.

- **What are Tuples and How to Use Them**
  - An introduction to tuples, their immutability, and common use cases.

- **When to Use Tuples Versus Lists**
  - Discussion on the scenarios where tuples are more appropriate than lists and vice versa.

- **What is a Sequence**
  - Definition and explanation of sequences in Python, including both mutable and immutable types.

- **What is Tuple Packing**
  - Understanding how to create tuples by packing values together.

- **What is Sequence Unpacking**
  - Explanation of how to unpack sequences into individual variables.

- **What is the `del` Statement and How to Use It**
  - An overview of the `del` statement for deleting items from lists or entire variables.
