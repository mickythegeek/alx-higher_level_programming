# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Description

This project explores advanced data structures in Python, specifically sets and dictionaries. You will learn how to effectively use these data structures, along with associated functions like `lambda`, `map`, `reduce`, and `filter`. By the end of this project, you'll be able to explain and implement these concepts without external references.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following:

### General
- **Why Python programming is awesome**
- **What are sets and how to use them**
  - Understand the concept of sets in Python and their unique properties.
  - Learn how to create and manipulate sets.
- **What are the most common methods of set and how to use them**
  - Explore methods like `add()`, `remove()`, `union()`, `intersection()`, and more.
- **When to use sets versus lists**
  - Learn the scenarios where sets are more appropriate than lists, especially when dealing with unique elements.
- **How to iterate into a set**
  - Understand how to loop through a set using Python's iteration techniques.
- **What are dictionaries and how to use them**
  - Learn the structure of dictionaries, how to create them, and how to access and manipulate their data.
- **When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets**
  - Identify situations where dictionaries are preferable for storing key-value pairs.
- **What is a key in a dictionary**
  - Understand the role of keys in dictionaries and how they are used to access values.
- **How to iterate over a dictionary**
  - Explore methods for iterating over keys, values, and key-value pairs in a dictionary.
- **What is a lambda function**
  - Learn about anonymous functions in Python and how to create them using `lambda`.
- **What are the map, reduce, and filter functions**
  - Understand how to apply `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` functions to collections for efficient data processing.

## Usage

This project will include examples and exercises to solidify your understanding of sets, dictionaries, and functional programming in Python.
